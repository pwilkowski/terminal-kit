/**
 * This static method is used behind the scene by
 * [.inputField()]{@link https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit/blob/master/doc/high-level.md#ref.inputField}
 * when auto-completion mechanisms kick in.
 *
 * This method is exposed in the API because
 * [.inputField()]{@link https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit/blob/master/doc/high-level.md#ref.inputField}
 * supports user-defined auto-completers, such auto-completers might take advantage of this method for its final
 * pass, after collecting relevant informations to feed it.
 *
 * [This is an example of its usage.]{@link https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit/blob/master/doc/high-level.md#ref.example.autoComplete}
 *
 * @param {string[]} array - Array of string, it is the list of completion candidates
 * @param {string} startString - string this is the input string to be completed
 * @param {boolean} [returnAlternatives=false] - when many candidates match the input, if returnAlternatives is set
 * then the method is allowed to return an array containing all matching candidates, else the input string
 * (startString) is returned unchanged
 * @param {string} [prefix=''] prepend that string to the response string, or add a prefix property to the response
 * array: when used in an inputField(), this cause this string to be prepended to the output of the auto-complete menu.
 * @param {string} [postfix=''] append that string to the response string, or add a postfix property to the response
 * array: when used in an inputField(), this cause this string to be appended to the output of the auto-complete menu.
 * @returns {string|*[]}
